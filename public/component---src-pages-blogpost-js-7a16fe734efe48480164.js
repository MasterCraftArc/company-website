Containerization allows for a single application and all of the components needed to run it (e.g., databases, configurations, default settings, etc) to be isolated and abstracted from the computing environment. This provides flexibility to leverage and deploy applications enterprise-wide, on any infrastructure (i.e., on-premise, cloud, or hybrid), and reduces the risk of vendor-lock with a single cloud service provider.

The individual applications communicate via well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs). Known as “microservices,” each application is fully abstractable from the rest of the system. For example, each microservice has its own, isolated business process flow, logic, data access layer, and codebase. Microservices represent an alternative approach to traditional, monolithic architectures for software systems. By decomposing complex software systems into smaller, self-contained functional units, microservices architectures enhance system reliability and limit the scope and scale of impact when an issue is detected. In this same manner, microservices architectures enable wide, cost-effective scalability and limit the amount of overhead or institutional knowledge required by individual developers. Rather than needing to learn the entire system and its dependencies, developers can work more efficiently, on smaller teams, and focus on ensuring the dependability of an individual microservice."),n.createElement("img",{className:"mt-2 mb-2 mx-auto",src:l.Z,alt:"Figure I: A visual comparison of monolithic vs. microservices architectures."}),n.createElement("p",{className:"text-center sm:text-lg"},"Figure I: A visual comparison of monolithic vs. microservices architectures."),n.createElement("p",{className:"mt-5 xl:mt-10 text-lg sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-normal md:font-thin"},"Within the Department of Defense, enterprise-wide availability of pre-approved, containerized microservices can significantly accelerate software development efforts by making the building blocks of software systems discoverable, available on-demand, and deployable in any computing environment.

They can be configured with other, independent microservices to support workflows and applications tailored to any unique mission.
