While the associated lexicon is continuously changing, there are a number of core concepts and key terms that one must be familiar with in order to effectively drive digital transformation in their organization. Often it’s difficult to find these terms in concepts in one place; even more frequently, it’s challenging to determine the connections and interrelationships among these concepts. The below is intended to serve as a living guide for those embarking on their own software transformation journey - especially those with a need for cloud-native capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Containers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers are packages of software that wrap all code, dependencies, and settings for a given application into a single, fully executable unit. Containerization allows for a single application and all of the components needed to run it (e.g., databases, configurations, default settings, etc) to be isolated and abstracted from the computing environment. This provides flexibility to leverage and deploy applications enterprise-wide, on any infrastructure (i.e., on-premise, cloud, or hybrid), and reduces the risk of vendor-lock with a single cloud service provider. Scaling the use of containers across the Department of Defense can increase software reuse across Components and significantly reduce the overhead burden on developers deploying the applications into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microservices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a microservice-based approach to software system architecture, the system is decomposed into many individual software applications that each perform discrete tasks or processes. The individual applications communicate via well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs). Known as “microservices,” each application is fully abstractable from the rest of the system. For example, each microservice has its own, isolated business process flow, logic, data access layer, and codebase. Microservices represent an alternative approach to traditional, monolithic architectures for software systems. By decomposing complex software systems into smaller, self-contained functional units, microservices architectures enhance system reliability and limit the scope and scale of impact when an issue is detected. In this same manner, microservices architectures enable wide, cost-effective scalability and limit the amount of overhead or institutional knowledge required by individual developers. Rather than needing to learn the entire system and its dependencies, developers can work more efficiently, on smaller teams, and focus on ensuring the dependability of an individual microservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure I: A visual comparison of monolithic vs. microservices architectures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Department of Defense, enterprise-wide availability of pre-approved, containerized microservices can significantly accelerate software development efforts by making the building blocks of software systems discoverable, available on-demand, and deployable in any computing environment. Given their decoupled nature (i.e., independent of a single system or workflow), microservices are highly composable. They can be configured with other, independent microservices to support workflows and applications tailored to any unique mission. Moreover, microservices that are containerized, configured and managed as a carefully chosen suite of services and functions can serve as pre-assembled software development pipelines that are infinitely scalable. This paper discusses this concept in greater detail under the section titled “Why Big Bang?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Container Orchestration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container orchestrators automate the deployment and management of containers on any infrastructure. This removes the need to redesign or reconfigure an application in order to deploy it to a different environment. Importantly, container orchestration also enables virtualization and scaling of containerized microservices such as storage, networking, and security which are foundational components of cloud-native applications. Orchestration tools configure containers based on declared states which indicate how the containers should run. Rather than having to manually redesign or reconfigure an application to run in a different environment, container orchestrators standardize deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the DoD context, containerized microservices and container orchestration can be used to provide a common, but extensible, platform that mission applications can be developed and run on top of. A common, secure platform would allow for better alignment between platform teams and mission application teams. In other words, creating greater standardization among platforms, while preserving the ability to quickly adapt and integrate new products or capabilities, would create a positive feedback loop between mission application teams and platform teams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is CD Really?]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are many misconceptions about continuous delivery.

There are also many things about CD that are not obvious on the
surface. If you are “CD curious”, perhaps this will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is CD?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is the ability to deploy the latest changes on demand. It is common for a single team skilled at CD
to deliver production changes several times per day or week. In a highly optimized delivery system, we can even achieve
“continuous deploy” where the pipeline validates individual changes and deploy them directly to production instead of
being batched with other changes in a release. Large batches of work are slow to give feedback and contain more defects,
so anything we can do to reduce batch size and accelerate feedback will improve quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people accustomed to legacy delivery methods this can sound terrifying. “How can we possibly get our quality
processes done that quickly? We’ll be breaking things constantly!” We can’t use the same quality processes. We need to
use better quality processes. CD is not only safer, but also reduces the cost of change and total cost of ownership for
product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the goals of CD?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the underlying concepts behind agile delivery in general. Several methods were developed
in the late 1990s to overcome some common problems with development. XP, Scrum, et al were all focused on addressing the
reality of software delivery is that one or more of the following is true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The requirements aren’t what the end-users need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have misunderstood the requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end-users’ needs change before we can deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the underlying problem that agile development methods are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational stability is another primary concern. It’s very common for organizations to establish a delivery method that
has layers of process and approvals to “ensure quality”. However, when there is a production incident, that process is
discarded because it takes too much time. Instead, we are left inventing a “hotfix” process on the fly where all of our
carefully designed quality checks are ignored for the sake of speed.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of CD is to solve both of these problems. The secret of CD is that we treat every change as an emergency change
and design a delivery flow optimized for operational support. We should always use our safest delivery method in an
emergency to prevent making a bad problem worse. We need that delivery method to also be fast so that we can meet our
operational goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For development, it is critical that we can get rapid feedback on stability and usefulness of what we are creating. We
need quality gates that can efficiently and effectively identify known issues. This gives us confidence that we are not
breaking things and allows us to deliver only what is needed and to make sure that what we deliver meets the actual
needs of the end-user. When it does not, we have the ability to rapidly change course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does a CD workflow look like?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD isn’t automation. CD uses automation to enable small batches of work. However, how we use that automation is key. We
need the correct processes to convert ideas we think are valuable to small changes we can deliver to the end-user to get
feedback on the value so we can adjust our ideas. The faster we can close that loop and the more waste we can drive out
the more successful we will be at value delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it CI/CD or CD?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just “CD”. Just as DevOps encompasses security, business, compliance, user experience, etc., CD encompasses the
entire development process. Continuous integration is the team behavior where all changes on the team are integrated
very rapidly and at a minimum daily. It’s required behavior for a CD workflow, so saying “CD” includes CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are some common ways to get it wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We will focus on CD after we have a working application.”&lt;/strong&gt; If doing greenfield development, the ability to deliver is feature zero. If we cannot deliver, we cannot verify quality and every change we make is only waste. We risk developing things that cannot be delivered at all if we don’t start with delivery first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We automated the build. We are doing CD.”&lt;/strong&gt; CD is how we use the tools. Automating the build is only step 1. How do we continuously harden the flow by adding better quality gates? How can we shorten the cycle time from commit to delivery? How can we reduce the lead time from request to delivery? How can we get more certainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about what needs to be delivered? These are all design and process problems that must be solved for CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our users don’t want changes that often”&lt;/strong&gt; They do when things are broken. CD is about operational stability first and feature delivery second. We need to know we can fix things quickly. We do that with constant practice. The best thing we have to practice with is the features we are delivering daily. Also, there is a big difference between generally exposing new features daily and just delivering changes daily to verify they do not break. Again, this is a quality process, not a feature delivery process. We need quality feedback from continuous testing in production instead of hoping our next big release doesn’t break anything. Your next big release will break something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do we need smarter people?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. You have smart people. However, CD is the tool that helps those smart people grow into more effective teams. Solving
the problem of “why can’t we deliver this change safely to production today?” is an engineering problem that takes
teamwork and disciplined development. We need to solve the problems of feature flagging, continuous integration,
developer-driven testing, effective monitoring and alerting, etc. It also improves morale due to the reduced toil, less
Fear Driven Development, improved quality, and improved teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CD is the most effective tool for digital transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t need scaling frameworks or standardized processes. CD acts as the engine for broader organizational
improvement. It exposes improvement opportunities in team workflow, but it also exposes problems that are external to
teams that prevent frequent delivery. Testing teams, external change approvals, external design approvals, etc. cease to
be features and quickly become recognized for what they are, wasteful defects, and bandages for poor quality process
that give us the illusion of safety. By putting our efforts towards enabling teams to deliver more efficiently,
effectively, and sustainably, we discover how to realign the entire organization around customer value. The organization
is delivering today at the highest level it can with the given structure and goals. Only by discovering what the
roadblocks are can we improve. “Why can’t every team deliver daily?” informs that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is the ultimate expession of agile development and is the reason for a DevOps operating model. If
you are on the DevOps journey or want to deliver with more agility, focus on continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

While their usage has become
ubiquitous over the past 6 years or so, their meaning frequently gets lost and implementation suffers because of this.
If we are clear on where DevOps came from, how it’s evolved, where it is going, we can better apply it to realize
improved outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start at the beginning. Why DevOps? (and don’t worry…we’ll get to DevSecOps)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in any design process, it would be wrong to jump straight to the solution and decide that DevOps is the answer if we
have not yet identified the problems we are trying to solve. We should never blindly follow trends. The goal is to
improve our ability to deliver what the user needs; to be more efficient, more effective, and more sustainable. We are
working to apply some of the best practices from lean manufacturing to the problem of software delivery. If you don’t
need to be more efficient, more effective, or more sustainable then DevOps is the wrong answer. However, the reality is
that software is now core to everything we do and the era of short-term projects instead of long term product management
is long past. Focusing on how we can more sustainably deliver changes with lower cost and higher delivered value while
making sure the results are stable and available is critical. A correctly conceptualized DevOps approach enables this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DevOps” has been applied to tools, teams, and job titles. Too frequently we hear phrases like “our DevOps engineers are
using Azure DevOps to build pipelines for the DevOps teams”. This misrepresents the reality of DevOps.. Tools are
required in DevOps, but there are no DevOps tools. Teams need DevOps, but labeling a team “DevOps” doesn’t make it so.
“DevOps Engineer” is a title with no clear definition which frequently equates to release management, but  having a
handoff for deploying changes is a DevOps anti-pattern. If we do not have the correct mental model then we will struggle
to implement correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, what is DevOps really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Microsoft’s Donovan Brown described DevOps as “the union of people, processes, and products to enable the
continuous delivery of value to the end-user.” This definition places the focus on where it belongs - on the continuous
delivery of value to the end-user. If we are not working daily to improve the ability of our organization to
continuously deliver value to the end-user so that we can get feedback, then it doesn’t matter what we call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isn’t it just “Dev” and “Ops” on the same team?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t been “Dev” and “Ops” for a long time. In 2008, Patrick Debois was trying to solve the problem of how to
deliver better. Development teams were “agile” but the overall flow of delivery was not. Development teams and
operations teams had different goals. Development teams were focused on shipping features and operations teams were
focused on system stability. The handoff between the groups generated conflict, delays, and waste because of misaligned
goals. Debois brought these groups together to align goals and improve the flow of delivery. While the origin of DevOps
is the harmonization of two teams with seemingly incompatible goals, DevOps has evolved greatly in the past 13 years. As
DevOps adopters shared successes and failures, it became apparent that value delivery is greatly enabled or greatly
impeded by broader organizational culture and practices. After some time a consensus emerged that it is ineffective to
focus on improving the efficiency of a single team if the surrounding organization does not adapt as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help describe how organizations should behave to support DevOps approaches and improve outcomes, John Willis and Jez
Humble developed the acronym CALMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(C)ulture of Learning and Improving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need the right culture. Output is not our goal; better outcomes are. We need a culture of trust, feedback, and learning. We need to trust each other and have the psychological safety to bring new ideas. We need to assume that we are wrong about most of our ideas and approach everything as an opportunity to get feedback on the idea. We need to build better feedback loops into every process so we don’t succumb to the sunk cost fallacy where we are too invested in the idea to throw it away. We need to share and celebrate success. We need to share and celebrate failure because now we can help others not waste their time on a poor idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(A)utomation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans should do creative work. Robots should do everything else. If there are rules to follow, that is where robots excel. Efficiencies gained from implementing technology such as robotic process automation should free up humans for higher-level cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(L)ean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need lean processes. We should constantly strive to identify and reduce waste in the system of delivery. This goes far beyond development. We must look at the whole system from ideas to sustainable operations of the outcomes of those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(M)etrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to measure the right things the right way to know where we are and what and how to improve next. We need measurable goals and appropriate metrics to track the health of the delivery system and our progress towards those goals. Metrics are a double edged sword. The act of measuring changes behaviors and we need to design metrics carefully to encourage the outcomes we want. We’ll dive deeper into this in upcoming posts, but it’s very important to understand your goals before selecting measures towards them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(S)haring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share what we have learned. We help people understand what and why something works or doesn’t work so that they can extend our successes and avoid repeating our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future posts, we will be diving deeper into culture, automation, lean, metrics, and sharing. These are the
touchstones of any DevOps improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DevSecOps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circa 2017, a new term began to appear, “DevSecOps”. DevOps should be secure! This term is often debated in the
community. As we said, DevOps isn’t Dev and Ops working together. DevOps is how we align the organization to
continuously deliver value to the end-user. It requires every capability in the value stream to accomplish this: product
knowledge, coding, user experience, quality, compliance, security, infrastructure, etc. None of these are more or less
important. All of those capabilities must exist in the value stream for something to be valuable. To continuously
deliver value to the end-user, everyone working on those capabilities needs to align on the most important goal, working
together to reduce waste, toil, delays, and conflict to optimize the entire system of value delivery. Each of these
capabilities should be enabled as a service, not a roadblock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Value Stream Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where DevOps is today. We know that it requires organizational cooperation to deliver at the pace we need. We
need product teams leveraging services from Security, Compliance, User eXperience, and other disciplines. We need agile
budgets if we want agile outcomes. Product funding instead of annual budgets that incentivize waste. We need product
roadmaps aligned to organizational goals and customer needs. We need operations organized in a way so that product teams
own the outcomes of their technical and quality decisions and that product owners can get rapid feedback on the quality
of the underlying ideas. We need to look at what our products are and relentlessly improve the constraints in the flow
of value for those products. Ultimately, we need to internalize that our goal is to deliver value to our end-users.
Anything we are doing at an organizational level that is hindering that goal must be improved.  DevOps isn’t a tool,
team, or role. DevOps is a holistic operating model focused on improving value delivery. It cannot be bought. It must be
lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be sharing here often. We hope you’ll follow along and we would love feedback on how we can help you succeed!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
